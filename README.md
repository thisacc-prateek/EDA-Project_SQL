* [Date Exploration:](#date-exploration) Calculating business operating duration and maximum/minimum days for delivery.
* [Measure Exploration:](#measure-exploration) Evaluating numerical fields like total sales, items sold, average selling price, total orders, products, and customers.
* [Key Metrics Report:](#key-metrics-report) Consolidated table of measure exploration.
* [Magnitude Analysis:](#magnitude-analysis) Analysing measures (customers by country, gender, etc) by categorical data.
* [Ranking Analysis:](#ranking-analysis) Extracting top product in most/least ordered category, highest/lowest revenue generating product, etc.
